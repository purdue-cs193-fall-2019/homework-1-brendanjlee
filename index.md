## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
### BIG BOLD LETTERS FOR ME

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List
3. Of some random stuff I need to fill out
4. Try to use your pinky when you want to use the backspace key and the 'p' key

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
**This Better Look Bold but not BIG**
_Italic words look nice but it's a little harder to read_

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
